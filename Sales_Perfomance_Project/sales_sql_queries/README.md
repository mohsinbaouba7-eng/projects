# 🎯 Introduction

Welcome to my Sales Performance Analysis portfolio project! This project explores a dataset of **10,000 Global Sales Records** to uncover critical insights regarding company profitability, regional trends, operational efficiency, and year-over-year financial growth. 

The goal of this analysis is to demonstrate how advanced SQL workflows can transform raw transactional records into actionable strategic business intelligence.

# Background








---
# 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
* **SQL (PostgreSQL):** Core engine used for complex data cleaning, aggregation, time-series calculations, and business analytics.
* **VS Code:** Development environment for writing scripts, managing version control, and organizing the project codebase.
* **Git & GitHub:** For project tracking, commit history, and public portfolio presentation.

# 🗂️ The Analysis

All data processing scripts are organized inside the [sale_sql_queries folder](/Sales_Perfomance_Project/sales_sql_queries/) folder. Below is an overview of what each script accomplishes:

### 1. Data Ingestion & Table Initialization
* **File:** `1_Creating_sales_table.sql`
* **Purpose:** Sets up the database schema, defines accurate data types (e.g., handling numeric fields for precision), and manages the initial import structure for the `10000 Sales Records.csv` dataset.

### 2. General Business Health
* **File:** `2_Total_financial_health_of_the_business.sql`
* **Purpose:** Calculates high-level executive KPIs including **Total Revenue**, **Total Cost**, and **Total Net Profit** across the entire lifetime of the dataset to evaluate global business performance.

### 3. Product & Inventory Optimization
* **File:** `3_Most_Profitable_Item_Type.sql`
* **Purpose:** Aggregates total profit grouped by item types (e.g., Cosmetics, Clothes, Office Supplies) to pinpoint which product categories drive the highest profit margins and should receive more marketing focus.

### 4. Geographic & Regional Trends
* **File:** `4_Performance_by_Region.sql`
* **Purpose:** Breaks down sales volume and total margins by global regions (such as Sub-Saharan Africa, Europe, Asia). This identifies our strongest geographic strongholds and maps out underperforming regional markets.

### 5. Historical Growth Tracking
* **File:** `5_YoY_Growth.sql`
* **Purpose:** Utilizes advanced window functions (`LAG()`, `LEAD()`) to calculate **Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth Rates**. This determines whether the company's financial trajectories are accelerating or slowing down over time.

### 6. Deep-Dive Seasonal Analysis
* **File:** `6_May_Profit 2016 vs 2017.sql`
* **Purpose:** Performs a localized comparative analysis isolating specific calendar periods (May 2016 vs. May 2017) to study short-term variance, seasonal spikes, or anomalies in customer purchasing behavior.

### 7. Logistics & Supply Chain Efficiency
* **File:** `7_Avr_delivery time vs Max_delivery_time.sql`
* **Purpose:** Shifts focus to operations by computing metrics based on order dates and ship dates. It compares average delivery times against maximum delays to flag supply chain bottlenecks.

## 💡 Key Technical Skills Demonstrated
* **Time-Series Analysis:** Querying dates, extracting years/months, and comparing historical performance periods.
* **Window Functions:** Employing statistical ranking and offset fields to build financial trend models without altering raw tables.
* **Aggregations & Filters:** Mastering structural clauses (`GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, mathematical operators) to compress 10,000 distinct data rows into clear executive summaries.
